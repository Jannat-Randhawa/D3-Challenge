          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Care, Obesity, Age and Income</h2>
          <p> The graph displays trends in 2014 amongst Health Care, Obesity, Age and Income gathered from the  U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
          To visualize trends amongst the data please click on the labels displayed on the graph. 
        For more detailed information about each state please click the circles on the graph with the abbreviated state names.</p>

          <p>Though the data in the graph is older than 2014 it is important to analyze the trend, 
            where poorer states like Texas and New Mexico lack healthcare, whereas richer states like Massachusets 
            and Conneticut have much better health care. 
            There is also a clear and a obvious trend in income and healthcare, where states with higher average income 
            are covered better for health care as compared to the the states with lower average income. 
            Interms of Age, people from the of 30 to 44 significantly lack healthcare all over US. Which is 
            a bit of a  concern. 
          </p>

          <p> With Obesity, states with lower average income show higher obesity rates, such as 
            Missisipi, West Virginia and Arkansas. This trend is inporpotion to the poverty scale as well, 
            where richer states seem to habve lower obesity rates. This could be because the cost of weekly 
            groceries is more expensive than the cost fast food. Hence, more people rely on it.
